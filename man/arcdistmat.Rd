\title{Calculation of distance matrices along arcs}
\usage{
arcdistmat(points1, points2 = NULL, origin = c(0, 0, 0),
  output = "distance", radius = authRadius)
}
\arguments{
\item{points1}{Numeric matrix, XYZ or longitude-latitude coordinates of the first set of points.}

\item{points2}{Numeric matrix, XYZ or longitude-latitude coordinates (matrix) of the second set of points. 
Leave this empty if you want all the arc distances between a set of points}

\item{origin}{Numeric vector, the center of the circle in XYZ coordinates (default is 0,0,0).}

\item{output}{Character value, the type of the output value. \code{"distance"} will give back the distance
in the metric that was fed to the function in the coordinates or the radius.
\code{"deg"} will output the the distance in degrees, \code{"rad"} will do
so in radians.}

\item{radius}{Numeric value, the radius of the circle in case the input points have polar coordinates only.
Unused when XYZ coordinates are entered. Defaults to the authalic radius of Earth ca. 6371.007km.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value.
}
\description{
This function calculates the shortest arc distance matrix between two set of points.
}
\details{
This function will create all possible shortest arc distances between points in the two sets,
	but not between the points within the sets. The function is useful for great circle distance calculations.
	For a symmetrical distance matrix leave the \code{points2} argument empty.

\examples{
g <- trigrid(c(4))
res <- arcdistmat(g@vertices)

rand<-rpsphere(500)
res2 <- arcdistmat(g@vertices, rand)
