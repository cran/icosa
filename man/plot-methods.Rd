\title{2d plotting of a facelayer class object
This function will invoke the 2d plotting methods of a grid so data stored in a facelayer object can be displayed.}
\usage{
\S4method{plot}{facelayer,ANY}(x, projargs = NULL, col = "red",
  border = NA, alpha = "", frame = FALSE, ...)

\S4method{plot}{trigrid,ANY}(x, projargs = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The facelayer object to be plotted.}

\item{projargs}{a projection string for the transformation fo coordinates. Accepts both a CRS class object and a character string that will be transformed to the CRS class.}

\item{col}{Character vector. Colors passed to a grDevices::colorRampPalette() in case of the facelayer contains logical values, a single value is required (defaults to red).}

\item{border}{Character value specifying the color of the borders of the cells.}

\item{alpha}{Character value of two digits for the fill colors, in hexadecimal value between 0 and 255.}

\item{frame}{Logical value, if TRUE the grid boundaries will be drawn with black.}

\item{...}{arguments passed to the sp::plot() function.}
}
\description{
The function passes arguments to the plot method of the SpatialPolygons class (â‚¬ref). In case a heatmap is plotted and the windows plotting device gets resized,
some misalignments can happen. If you want to use a differently sized window, use windows() to set the height and width before running the function.

This function will invoke the \code{plot()} method of the SpatialPolygons class.
